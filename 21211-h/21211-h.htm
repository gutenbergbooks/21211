<p>LES DEMOISELLES DE SAUVE</p>
<p>TO S. A. S. ALICE, PRINCESSE DE MONACO</p>
<p><i>Beautiful ladies through the orchard pass;<br>
Bend under crutched-up branches, forked and low;<br>
Trailing their samet palls o'er dew-drenched grass.</i></p>
<p><i>Pale blossoms, looking on proud Jacqueline,<br>
Blush to the colour of her finger tips,<br>
And rosy knuckles, laced with yellow lace.</i></p>
<p><i>High-crested Berthe discerns, with slant, clinched
eyes,<br>
Amid the leaves pink faces of the skies;<br>
She locks her plaintive hands Sainte-Margot-wise.</i></p>
<p><i>Ysabeau follows last, with languorous pace;<br>
Presses, voluptuous, to her bursting lips.<br>
With backward stoop, a bunch of eglantine.</i></p>
<p><i>Courtly ladies through the orchard pass;<br>
Bow low, as in lords' halls; and springtime grass<br>
Tangles a snare to catch the tapering toe.</i></p>
<br>
<br>
<p>HEART'S DEMESNE</p>
<p>TO PAUL VERLAINE</p>
<p><i>Listen, bright lady, thy deep Pansie eyes<br>
Made never answer when my eyes did pray,<br>
Than with those quaintest looks of blank surprise.</i></p>
<p><i>But my love longing has devised a way<br>
To mock thy living image, from thy hair<br>
To thy rose toes and keep thee by alway.</i></p>
<p><i>My garden's face is oh! so maidly fair,<br>
With limbs all tapering and with hues all fresh;<br>
Thine are the beauties all that flourish there.</i></p>
<p><i>Amaranth, fadeless, tells me of thy flesh.<br>
Briar rose knows thy cheek, the Pink thy pout.<br>
Bunched kisses dangle from the Woodbine mesh.</i></p>
<p><i>I love to loll, when Daisy stars peep out,<br>
And hear the music of my garden dell,<br>
Hollyhock's laughter and the Sunflowers shout.</i></p>
<p><i>And many whisper things I dare not tell.</i></p>
<br>
<br>
<p>SONG OF THE SEEDLING</p>
<p>TO ARTHUR SEWELL BUTT</p>
<p><i>Tell, little seedling, murmuring germ,<br>
Why are you joyful? What do you sing?<br>
Have you no fear of that crawling thing,<br>
Him that has so many legs? and the worm?</i></p>
<p><i>Rain drops patter above my head&mdash;<br>
    Drip, drip, drip.<br>
To moisten the mould where my roots are fed&mdash;<br>
    Sip, sip, sip.<br>
No thought have I of the legged thing.<br>
    Of the worm no fear,<br>
    When the goal is so near;<br>
Every moment my life has run,<br>
The livelong day I've not ceased to sing:<br>
I must reach the sun, the sun.</i></p>
<br>
<br>
<p>LADY EVELYN</p>
<p><i>I know no Name too sweet to tell of her,<br>
For Love's sweet Sake and Domination.<br>
She hath me all; her Spell hath Power to stir<br>
My Heart to every Lust, and spur me on.<br>
Love saith: 'tis even thus; her Will no Thrall,<br>
But Touchstone of thy Worth in Love's Armure;<br>
They only conquer in Love's Lists that fall,<br>
And Wounds renewed for Wounds are captain Cure.<br>
He doubly is inslaved that gilts his Chain,<br>
Saith Reason, chaffering for his Empire gone,<br>
Bestir, and root the Canker that hath ta'en<br>
Thy Breast for Bed, and feeds thy Heart upon.</i></p>
<p><i>I this: Sweet Love, an sweet an sour thou be,<br>
I know no Name too sweet to tell of thee.</i></p>
<br>
<br>
<p>COMPLAINT</p>
<p>TO FELIX F&Eacute;N&Eacute;ON</p>
<p><i>Men, women, call thee so or so;<br>
    I do not know.<br>
    Thou hast no name<br>
For me, but in my heart aflame</i></p>
<p><i>Burns tireless, neath a silver vine.<br>
    And round entwine<br>
    Its purple girth<br>
All things of fragrance and of worth.</i></p>
<p><i>Thou shout! thou burst of light! thou throb<br>
    Of pain! thou sob!<br>
    Thou like a bar<br>
Of some sonata, heard from far</i></p>
<p><i>Through blue-hue'd veils! When in these wise,<br>
    To my soul's eyes,<br>
    Thy shape appears,<br>
My aching hands are full of tears.</i></p>
<br>
<br>
<p>A HALTING SONNET</p>
<p>TO MISS ELLEN TERRY ON HER BIRTHDAY</p>
<p><i>It is not meet for one like me to praise<br>
A lady, princess, goddess, artist such;<br>
For great ones crane their foreheads to her touch,<br>
To change their splendours into crowns of bays.<br>
But poets never rhyme as they are bid;<br>
Nor never see their ft goal; but aspire,<br>
With straining eyes, to some far silvern spire;<br>
Flowers among, sing to the gods cloud-hid.<br>
One of these, onetime, opened velvet eyes<br>
Upon the world&mdash;the years recall the day;<br>
Those lights still shine, conscious of power alway,<br>
But flattering men with feigned looks of surprise.</i></p>
<p><i>    The couplet is so great that, where thou art,<br>
    &mdash;Thou being a poem&mdash;it is past my art.</i></p>
<br>
<br>
<p>WINGS IN THE DARK</p>
<p>TO ROBERT HARBOROUGH SHERARD</p>
<p><i>Forth into the warm darkness faring wide&mdash;<br>
More silent momently the silent quay&mdash;<br>
Towards where the ranks of boats rock to the tide,<br>
Muffling their plaintive gurgling jealously.</i></p>
<p><i>With gentle nodding of her gracious snout,<br>
One greets her master till he step aboard;<br>
She flaps her wings, impatient to get out;<br>
She runs to plunder, straining every cord,</i></p>
<p><i>Full-winged and stealthy like a bird of prey,<br>
All tense the muscles of her seemly flanks;<br>
She, the coy creature that the idle day<br>
Sees idly riding in the idle ranks.</i></p>
<p><i>Backward and forth, over the chosen ground,<br>
Like a young horse, she drags the heavy trawl,<br>
Tireless; or speeds her rapturous course unbound,<br>
And passing fishers through the darkness call</i></p>
<p><i>Deep greeting, in the jargon of the sea.<br>
Haul upon haul, flounders and soles and dabs,<br>
And phosphorescent animalcule,<br>
Sand, seadrift, weeds, thousands of worthless crabs.</i></p>
<p><i>Low on the mud the darkling fishes grope.<br>
Cautious to stir, staring with jewel eyes;<br>
Dogs of the sea, the savage congers mope,<br>
Winding their sulky march Meander-wise.</i></p>
<p><i>Suddenly all is light and life and flight,<br>
Upon the sandy bottom, agate strewn.<br>
The fishers mumble, waiting till the night<br>
Urge on the clouds, and cover up the moon.</i></p>
<br>
<br>
<p>THE BARBER<br>
<br>
I</p>
<p><i>I dreamed I was a barber; and there went<br>
Beneath my hand, oh! manes extravagant.<br>
Beneath my trembling fingers, many a mask<br>
Of many a pleasant girl. It was my task<br>
To gild their hair, carefully, strand by strand;<br>
To paint their eyebrows with a timid hand;<br>
To draw a bodkin, from a vase of kohl,<br>
Through the closed lashes; pencils from a bowl<br>
Of sepia to paint them underneath;<br>
To blow upon their eyes with a soft breath.<br>
They lay them back and watched the leaping bands.</i></p>
II<br>
<p><i>The dream grew vague. I moulded with my hands<br>
The mobile breasts, the valley; and the waist<br>
I touched; and pigments reverently placed<br>
Upon their thighs in sapient spots and stains,<br>
Beryls and crysolites and diaphanes,<br>
And gems whose hot harsh names are never said.<br>
I was a masseur; and my fingers bled<br>
With wonder as I touched their awful limbs.</i></p>
III<br>
<p><i>Suddenly, in the marble trough, there seems<br>
O, last of my pale, mistresses, Sweetness!<br>
A twylipped scarlet pansie. My caress<br>
Tinges thy steelgray eyes to violet.<br>
Adown thy body skips the pit-a-pat<br>
Of treatment once heard in a hospital<br>
For plagues that fascinate, but half appal.</i></p>
IV<br>
<p><i>So, at the sound, the blood of me stood cold.<br>
Thy chaste hair ripened into sullen gold.<br>
The throat, the shoulders, swelled and were uncouth.<br>
The breasts rose up and offered each a mouth.<br>
And on the belly pallid blushes crept,<br>
That maddened me, until I laughed and wept.</i></p>
<br>
<br>
<p>MISHKA</p>
<p>TO HENRI TEIXEIRA DE MATTOS</p>
<p><i>Mishka is poet among the beasts.<br>
When roots are rotten, and rivers weep.<br>
The bear is at play in the land of sleep.<br>
Though his head be heavy between his fists.<br>
The bear is poet among the beasts.</i></p>
<p>THE DREAM:</p>
<p><i>Wide and large are the monster's eyes,<br>
Nought saying, save one word alone:<br>
Mishka! Mishka, as turned to stone,<br>
Hears no word else, nor in anywise<br>
Can see aught save the monster's eyes.</i></p>
<p><i>Honey is under the monster's lips;<br>
And Mishka follows into her lair,<br>
dragged in the net of her yellow hair,<br>
Knowing all things when honey drips<br>
On his tongue like rain, the song of the hips</i></p>
<p><i>Of the honey-child, and of each twin mound.<br>
Mishka! there screamed a far bird-note,<br>
Deep in the sky, when round his throat<br>
The triple coil of her hair she wound.<br>
And stroked his limbs with a humming sound.</i></p>
<p><i>Mishka is white like a hunter's son<br>
Tor he knows no more of the ancient south<br>
When the honey-child's lips are on his mouth,<br>
When all her kisses are joined in one,<br>
And his body is bathed in grass and sun.</i></p>
<p><i>The shadows lie mauven beneath the trees,<br>
And purple stains, where the finches pass,<br>
Leap in the stalks of the deep, rank grass.<br>
Flutter of-wing, and the buzz of bees,<br>
Deepen the silence, and sweeten ease.</i></p>
<p><i>The honey-child is an olive tree,<br>
The voice of birds and the voice of flowers,<br>
Each of them all and all the hours,<br>
The honey-child is a winged bee,<br>
Her touch is a perfume, a melody.</i></p>
<br>
<br>
<p>SUMMER PAST</p>
<p>TO OSCAR WILDE</p>
<p><i>There was the summer. There<br>
    Warm hours of leaf-lipped song,<br>
    And dripping amber sweat.<br>
        O sweet to see<br>
The great trees condescend to cast a pearl<br>
Down to the myrtles; and the proud leaves curl<br>
        In ecstasy.</i></p>
<p><i>    Fruit of a quest, despair.<br>
    Smart of a sullen wrong.<br>
    Where may they hide them yet?<br>
        One hour, yet one,<br>
To find the mossgod lurking in his nest,<br>
To see the naiads' floating hair, caressed<br>
        By fragrant sun.</i></p>
<p><i>    Beams. Softly lulled the eves<br>
    The song-tired birds to sleep,<br>
    That other things might tell<br>
        Their secrecies.<br>
The beetle humming neath the fallen leaves.<br>
Deep in what hollow do the stern gods keep<br>
Their bitter silence? By what listening well<br>
        Where holy trees,</i></p>
<p><i>Song-set, unfurl eternally the sheen<br>
        Of restless green?</i></p>
<br>
<br>
<p>THE VINES</p>
<p>TO ANDR&Eacute; CHEVRILLON</p>
<p><i>"Have you seen the listening snake?"<br>
bramble clutches for his bride,<br>
Lately she was by his side,<br>
Woodbine, with her gummy hands.</i></p>
<p><i>In the ground the mottled snake<br>
Listens for the dawn of day;<br>
Listens, listening death away,<br>
Till the day burst winter's bands.</i></p>
<p><i>Painted ivy is asleep,<br>
Stretched upon the bank, all torn,<br>
Sinewy though she be; love-lorn<br>
Convolvuluses cease to creep.</i></p>
<p><i>Bramble clutches for his bride,<br>
Woodbine, with her gummy hands,<br>
All his horny claws expands;<br>
She has withered in his grasp.</i></p>
<p><i>"Till the day dawn, till the tide<br>
Of the winter's afternoon."<br>
"Who tells dawning?"&mdash;"Listen, soon."<br>
Half born tendrils, grasping, gasp.</i></p>
<br>
<br>
<p><i>Je pleure dans les coins; je n'ai plus go&ucirc;t &agrave;
rien;<br>
Oh! j'ai tant pleur&eacute;, Dimanche, en mon paroissien!</i></p>
<p>JULES LAFORGUE</p>
<p><i>Did we not, Darling, you and I,<br>
Walk on the earth like other men?<br>
Did we not walk and wonder why<br>
They spat upon us so. And then</i></p>
<p><i>We lay us down among fresh earthy<br>
Sweet flowers breaking overhead,<br>
Sore needed rest for our frail girth,<br>
For our frail hearts; a well-sought bed.</i></p>
<p><i>So Spring came, and spread daffodils;<br>
Summer, and fluffy bees sang on;<br>
The fluffy bee knows us, and fills<br>
His house with sweet to think upon.</i></p>
<p><i>Deep in the dear dust, Dear, we dream,<br>
Our melancholy is a thing<br>
At last our own; and none esteem<br>
How our black lips are blackening.</i></p>
<p><i>And none note how our poor eyes fall,<br>
Nor how our cheeks are sunk and sere . . .<br>
Dear, when you waken, will you call? . . .<br>
Alas! we are not very near.</i></p>
<br>
<br>
<p><i>Ainsi, elle viendrait &agrave; moi! les yeux bien fous!<br>
Et elle me suivrait avec cet air partout!</i></p>
<p>TO E. M. G.</p>
<p><i>Lean back, and press the pillow deep,<br>
Heart's dear demesne, dear Daintiness;<br>
Close your tired eyes, but not to sleep . . .<br>
How very pale your pallor is!</i></p>
<p><i>You smile, your cheek's voluptuous line<br>
Melts in your dimpled saucy cave.<br>
Your hairbraids seem a wilful vine,<br>
Scorning to imitate a wave.</i></p>
<p><i>Your voice is tenebrous, as if<br>
An angel mocked a blackbird's pipe.<br>
You are my magic orchard feoff,<br>
Where bud and fruit are always ripe.</i></p>
<p><i>O apple garden! all the days<br>
Are fain to crown the darling year,<br>
Ephemeral bells and garland bays,<br>
Shy blade and lusty, bursting ear.</i></p>
<p><i>In every kiss I call you mine,<br>
Tell me, my dear, how pure, how brave<br>
Our child will be! what velvet eyne,<br>
What bonny hair our child will have!</i></p>
<br>
<br>
<p>CROCUSES IN GRASS</p>
<p>TO CHARLES HAZELWOOD SHANNON</p>
<p><i>Purple and white the crocus flowers,<br>
    And yellow, spread upon<br>
    The sober lawn; the hours<br>
Are not more idle in the sun.</i></p>
<p><i>Perhaps one droops a prettier head,<br>
    And one would say: Sweet Queen,<br>
    Your lips are white and red,<br>
And round you lies the grass most green.</i></p>
<p><i>And she, perhaps, for whom is fain<br>
    The other, will not heed;<br>
    Or, that he may complain,<br>
Babbles, for dalliaunce, with a weed.</i></p>
<p><i>And he dissimulates despair,<br>
    And anger, and suprise;<br>
    The while white daisies stare<br>
&mdash;And stir not&mdash;with their yellow eyes.</i></p>
<br>
<br>
<p>POEM</p>
<p>TO ARTHUR EDMONDS</p>
<p><i>Geranium, houseleek, laid in oblong beds<br>
On the trim grass. The daisies' leprous stain<br>
Is fresh. Each night the daisies burst again,<br>
Though every day the gardener crops their heads.</i></p>
<p><i>A wistful child, in foul unwholesome shreds,<br>
Recalls some legend of a daisy chain<br>
That makes a pretty necklace. She would fain<br>
Make one, and wear it, if she had some threads.</i></p>
<p><i>Sun, leprous flowers, foul child. The asphalt burns.<br>
The garrulous sparrows perch on metal Burns.<br>
Sing! Sing! they say, and flutter with their wings.<br>
He does not sing, he only wonders why<br>
He is sitting there. The sparrows sing. And I<br>
Yield to the strait allure of simple things.</i></p>
<br>
<br>
<p>ON A PICTURE</p>
<p>TO PIERRE LOU&Yuml;S</p>
<p><i>Not pale, as one in sleep or holier death,<br>
Nor illcontent the lady seems, nor loth<br>
To lie in shadow of shrill river growth,<br>
So steadfast are the river's arms beneath.</i></p>
<p><i>Pale petals follow her in very faith,<br>
Unmixed with pleasure or regret, and both<br>
Her maidly hands look up, in noble sloth<br>
To take the blossoms of her scattered wreath.</i></p>
<p><i>No weakest ripple lives to kiss her throat.<br>
Nor dies in meshes of untangled hair;<br>
No movement stirs the floor of river moss.</i></p>
<p><i>Until some furtive glimmer gleam across<br>
Voluptuous mouth, where even teeth are bare,<br>
And gild the broidery of her petticoat. . . .</i></p>
<br>
<br>
<p>PARSIFAL IMITATED FROM THE FRENCH<br>
OF PAUL VERLAINE</p>
<p><i>Conquered the flower-maidens, and the wide embrace<br>
Of their round proffered arms, that tempt the virgin boy;<br>
Conquered the trickling of their babbling tongues; the coy<br>
Back glances, and the mobile breasts of subtle grace;</i></p>
<p><i>Conquered the Woman Beautiful, the fatal charm<br>
Of her hot breast, the music of her babbling tongue;<br>
Conquered the gate of Hell, into the gate the young<br>
Man passes, with the heavy trophy at his arm,</i></p>
<p><i>The holy Javelin that pierced the Heart of God.<br>
He heals the dying king, he sits upon the throne,<br>
King, and high priest of that great gift, the living
Blood.</i></p>
<p><i>In robe of gold the youth adores the glorious Sign<br>
Of the green goblet, worships the mysterious Wine.<br>
And oh! the chime of children's voices in the dome.</i></p>
<br>
<br>
<p>A CRUCIFIX</p>
<p>TO ERNEST DOWSON</p>
<p><i>A gothic church. At one end of an aisle,<br>
Against a wall where mystic sunbeams smile<br>
Through painted windows, orange, blue, and gold,<br>
The Christ's unutterable charm behold.<br>
Upon the cross, adorned with gold and green,<br>
Long fluted golden tongues of sombre sheen,<br>
Like four flames joined in one, around the head<br>
And by the outstretched arms, their glory spread.<br>
The statue is of wood; of natural size<br>
Tinted; one almost sees before one's eyes<br>
The last convulsion of the lingering breath.<br>
"Behold the man!" Robust and frail. Beneath<br>
That breast indeed might throb the Sacred Heart.<br>
And from the lips, so holily dispart,<br>
The dying murmur breathes "Forgive! Forgive!"<br>
O wide-stretched arms! "I perish, let them live."<br>
Under the torture of the thorny crown,<br>
The loving pallor of the brow looks down<br>
On human blindness, on the toiler's woes;<br>
The while, to overturn Despair's repose,<br>
And urge to Hope and Love, as Faith demands,<br>
Bleed, bleed the feet, the broken side, the hands.<br>
A poet, painter, Christian,&mdash;it was a friend<br>
Of mine&mdash;his attributes most fitly blend&mdash;<br>
Who saw this marvel, made an exquisite<br>
Copy; and, knowing how I worshipped it,<br>
Forgot it, in my room, by accident.<br>
I write these verses in acknowledgment.</i></p>
<br>
<br>
<p>LE CHEVALIER MALHEUR</p>
<p><i>Grim visor'd cavalier!<br>
        Rides silently MISCHANCE.<br>
Stabbed is my dying heart<br>
        of his unpitying lance.<br>
My poor hearts blood leaps forth,<br>
        a single crimson jet.<br>
The hot sun licks it up<br>
        where petals pale are wet.<br>
Deep shadow seals my sight,<br>
        one shriek my lips has fed.<br>
With a wrung, sullen shudder<br>
        my poor heart is dead.<br>
The cavalier dismounts;<br>
        and, kneeling on the ground,<br>
His finger iron-mailed<br>
        he thrusts into the wound.<br>
Suddenly, at the freezing touch,<br>
        the iron smart,<br>
At once within me bursts<br>
        a new, a noble heart.<br>
Suddenly, as the steel<br>
        into the wound is pressed,<br>
A heart all beautiful<br>
        and young throbs in my breast.<br>
Trembling, incredulous<br>
        I sat; but ill at ease,<br>
As one who, in a holy trance,<br>
        strange visions sees.<br>
While the good cavalier,<br>
        remounted on his horse,<br>
Left me a parting nod<br>
        as he retook his course,<br>
And shouted to me<br>
        (still I hear his cries):<br>
"Once only can the miracle<br>
        avail.&mdash;Be wise!"</i><br>
<br>
<br></p>
<p>SPLEEN</p>
<p><i>The roses every one were red,<br>
And all the ivy leaves were black.</i></p>
<p><i>Sweet, do not even stir your head,<br>
Or all of my despairs come back.</i></p>
<p><i>The sky is too blue, too delicate:<br>
Too soft the air, too green the sea.</i></p>
<p><i>I fear&mdash;-how long had I to wait!&mdash;<br>
That you will tear yourself from me.</i></p>
<p><i>The shining box-leaves weary me,<br>
The varnished holly's glistening,</i></p>
<p><i>The stretch of infinite country;<br>
So, saving you, does everything.</i></p>
<br>
<br>
<p>CLAIR DE LUNE</p>
<p><i>How like a well-kept garden is your soul,<br>
With bergomask and solemn minuet!<br>
Playing upon the lute! The dancers seem<br>
But sad, beneath their strange habiliments.<br>
While, in the minor key, their songs extol<br>
The victor Love, and life's sweet blandishments,<br>
Their looks belie the burden of their lays,<br>
The songs that mingle with the still moon-beams.<br>
So strange, so beautiful, the pallid rays;<br>
Making the birds among the branches dream,<br>
And sob with ecstasy the slender jets,</i></p>
<p><i>The fountains tall that leap upon the lawns<br>
Amid the garden gods, the marble fauns.</i></p>
<br>
<br>
<p>MON DIEU M'A DIT:  . . .</p>
<p><i>God has spoken: Love me,<br>
        son, thou must; Oh see<br>
My broken side; my heart,<br>
        its rays refulgent shine;<br>
My feet, insulted, stabbed,<br>
        that Mary bathes with brine<br>
Of bitter tears my sad arms,<br>
        helpless, son, for thee;</i></p>
<p><i>With thy sins heavy; and my hands;<br>
        thou seest the rod;<br>
Thou seest the nails, the sponge,<br>
        the gall; and all my pain<br>
Must teach thee love, amidst a world<br>
        where flesh doth reign,<br>
My flesh alone, my blood,<br>
        my voice, the voice of God,</i></p>
<p><i>Say, have I not loved thee,<br>
        loved thee to death,<br>
O brother in my Father,<br>
        in the Spirit son?<br>
Say, as the word is written,<br>
        is my work not done?<br>
Thy deepest woe have I not sobbed<br>
        with struggling breath?<br>
Has not thy sweat of anguished nights<br>
        from all my pores in pain<br>
Of blood dripped, piteous friend,<br>
        who seekest me in vain?</i></p>
<br>
<br>
<p>GREEN</p>
<p><i>Leaves and branches, flowers and fruits are here;<br>
And here my heart, which throbs alone for thee.<br>
Ah! do not wound my heart with those two dear<br>
White hands, but take the poor gift tenderly.</i></p>
<p><i>I come, all covered with the dews of night<br>
The morning breeze has pearled upon my face.<br>
Let my fatigue, at thy feet, in thy sight,<br>
Dream through the moments of its sweet solace.</i></p>
<p><i>With thy late kisses ringing, let my head<br>
Roll in blest indolence on thy young breast;<br>
To lull the tempest thy caresses bred,<br>
And soothe my senses with a little rest.</i></p>
<br>
<br>
<p>FLEURS.  IMITATED FROM THE FRENCH<br>
OF STEPHANE MALLARM&Eacute;</p>
<p><i>The tawny iris&mdash;oh! the slim-necked swan;<br>
And, sign of exiled souls, the bay divine;<br>
Ruddy as seraph's heel its fleckless sheen,<br>
Blushing the brightness of a trampled dawn.</i></p>
<p><i>The hyacinth; the myrtle's sweet alarm;<br>
Like to a woman's flesh, the cruel rose,<br>
Blossom'd Herodiade of the garden close,<br>
Fed with ferocious dew of blooddrops warm.</i></p>
<p><i>Thou mad'st the lilies' pallor, nigh to swoon.<br>
Which, rolling billows of deep sighs upon,<br>
Through the blue incense of horizons wan,<br>
Creeps dreamily towards the weeping moon.</i></p>
<p><i>Praise in the censers, praise upon the gong,<br>
Madone! from the garden of our woes:<br>
On eves celestial throb the echo long!<br>
Ecstatic visions! radiance of haloes!</i></p>
<p><i>Mother creatrice! in thy strong, just womb,<br>
Challices nodding the not distant strife;<br>
Great honey'd blossoms, a balsamic tomb<br>
For weary poets blanched with starless life.</i></p>

<p>CHARLEVILLE.  IMITATED FROM THE FRENCH<br>
OF ARTHUR RIMBAUD</p>
<p>TO FRANK HARRIS</p>
<p><i>The square, with gravel paths and shabby lawns.<br>
Correct, the trees and flowers repress their yawns.<br>
The tradesman brings his favourite conceit,<br>
To air it, while he stifles with the heat.</i></p>
<p><i>In the kiosk, the military band.<br>
The shakos nod the time of the quadrilles.<br>
The flaunting dandy strolls about the stand.<br>
The notary, half unconscious of his seals.</i></p>
<p><i>On the green seats, small groups of grocermen,<br>
Absorbed, their sticks scooping a little hole<br>
Upon the path, talk market prices; then<br>
Take up a cue: I think, upon the whole. . . .</i></p>
<p><i>The loutish roughs are larking on the grass.<br>
The sentimental trooper, with a rose<br>
Between his teeth, seeing a baby, grows<br>
More tender, with an eye upon the nurse.</i></p>
<p><i>Unbuttoned, like a student, I follow<br>
A couple of girls along the chesnut row.<br>
They know I am following, for they turn and laugh,<br>
Half impudent, half shy, inviting chaff.</i></p>
<p><i>I do not say a word. I only stare<br>
At their round, fluffy necks. I follow where<br>
The shoulders drop; I struggle to define<br>
The subtle torso's hesitating line.</i></p>
<p><i>Only my rustling tread, deliberate, slow;<br>
The rippled silence from the still leaves drips.<br>
They think I am an idiot, they speak low;<br>
&mdash; I feel faint kisses creeping on my lips.</i></p>
<br>
<br>
<p>SENSATION</p>
<p><i>I walk the alleys trampled through the wheat,<br>
Through whole blue summer eves, on velvet grass.<br>
Dreaming, I feel the dampness at my feet;<br>
The breezes bathe my naked head and pass.</i></p>
<p><i>I do not think a single thought, nor say<br>
A word; but in my soul the mists upcurl<br>
Of infinite love. I will go far away<br>
With nature, happily, as with a girl.</i></p>
<br>
<br>
<p>&Agrave; UNE MADONE.  IMITATED FROM THE FRENCH<br>
OF CHARLES BAUDELAIRE</p>
<p><i>Madone! my lady, I will build for thee<br>
A grotto altar of my misery.<br>
Deep will I scoop, where darkest lies my heart,<br>
Far from the world's cupidity apart,</i></p>
<p><i>A niche, with mercy stained, and streaked with gold,<br>
Where none thy statue's wonder may behold.</i></p>
<p><i>Then, for thy head, I will fashion a tiar,<br>
A filigree of verse, with many a star</i></p>
<p><i>Of crystal rhyme its heavy folds upon.<br>
And jealousy, O mortal! my Madone,</i></p>
<p><i>Shall cut for thee a gown, of dreadful guise,<br>
Which like a portcullis, shall veil thy thighs;</i></p>
<p><i>Rude, heavy curtain, faced with bitter fears,<br>
Broidered, in place of pearls, with all my tears.</i></p>
<p><i>And, of my worship, shoes will I design;<br>
Two satin shoes, to case thy feet divine,</i></p>
<p><i>Which, while their precious freight they softly hold,<br>
Shall guard the imprint in a faithful mould.</i></p>
<p><i>If I should fail to forge a silver moon,<br>
I with my art, for thee to tread upon,</i></p>
<p><i>Then will I place the writhing beast that hangs<br>
Upon my heart, and tears it with his fangs,</i></p>
<p><i>Where thou may'st crush his head, and smile supreme,<br>
O majesty! all potent to redeem.</i></p>
<p><i>And all my thoughts, like candles, shalt thou see<br>
before thine altar spread, Star of the Sea!</i></p>
<p><i>Starring thine azure roof with points of fire.<br>
With nought hut thee to cherish and admire,</i></p>
<p><i>So shall my soul in plaintive fumes arise<br>
Of incense ever to thy pitying eyes.<br>
 </i></p>
<p><i>Last, that indeed a Mary thou may'st be,<br>
And that my love be mixed with cruelty&mdash;</i></p>
<p><i>O foul voluptuousness! when I have made<br>
Of every deadly sin a deadlier blade,</i></p>
<p><i>Torturer filled with pain will I draw near<br>
The target of thy breast, and, sick with fear,</i></p>
<p><i>Deliberately plant them all where throbs<br>
Thy bleeding heart, and stifling with its sobs.</i></p>
<br>
<br>
<p>FEMMES DAMN&Eacute;ES</p>
<p><i>Like moody beasts they lie along the sands;,<br>
Look where the sky against the sea-rim clings:<br>
Foot stretches out to foot, and groping hands<br>
Have languors soft and bitter shudderings.</i></p>
<p><i>Some, smitten hearts with the long secrecies,<br>
On velvet moss, deep in their bowers' ease,<br>
Prattling the love of timid infancies,<br>
Are tearing the green bark from the young trees.</i></p>
<p><i>Others, like sisters, slowly walk and grave;<br>
By rocks that swarm with ghostly legions,<br>
Where Anthony saw surging on the waves<br>
The purple breasts of his temptations,</i></p>
<p><i>Some, by the light of crumbling, resinous gums,<br>
In the still hollows of old pagan dens,<br>
Call thee in aid to their deliriums<br>
O Bacchus! cajoler of ancient pains.</i></p>
<p><i>And those whose breasts for scapulars are fain<br>
Nurse under their long robes the cruel thong.<br>
These, in dim woods, where huddling shadows throng.<br>
Mix with the foam of pleasure tears of pain.</i></p>
<br>
<br>
<p>LE VOYAGE &Agrave; CYTH&Egrave;RE</p>
<p><i>Bird-like, my heart was glad to soar and vault;<br>
Fluttering among the cordages; and on<br>
The vessel flew, under an empty vault:<br>
An angel drunken of a radiant sun.</i></p>
<p><i>Tell me, what is that gray, that sombre isle?<br>
'Tis Cythera, famed on many a poet string;<br>
A name that has not lacked the slavering smile;<br>
But now, you see, it is not much to sing.</i></p>
<p><i>Isle of soft whispers, tremours of the heart!<br>
The splendid phantom of thy rude goddess<br>
Floats on thy seas like breath of spikenard,<br>
Charging men's souls with love and lusciousness.</i></p>
<p><i>Sweet isle of myrtles, once of open blooms:<br>
Now only of lean lands most lean: it seems<br>
A flinty desert bitter with shrill screams:<br>
But one strange object on its horror looms.</i></p>
<p><i>Not a fair temple, foiled with coppiced trees,<br>
Where the young priestess, mistress of the flowers,<br>
Goes opening her gown to the cool breeze,<br>
To still the fire, the torment that devours.</i></p>
<p><i>But as along the shore we skirted, near<br>
Enough to scare the birds with our white sails,<br>
We saw a three-limbed gibbet rising sheer.<br>
Detached against the sky in spare details.</i></p>
<p><i>Perched on their pasturage, ferocious fowl<br>
Riddled with rage a more than putrid roast;<br>
Each of them stabbing, like a tool, his foul<br>
Beak in the oozing members of his host.</i></p>
<p><i>Below, a troop of jealous quadrupeds,<br>
Looking aloft with eye and steadfast snout;<br>
A larger beast above the others' heads,<br>
A hangman with his porters round about.</i></p>
<p><i>The eyes, two caves; and from the rotten paunch,<br>
Its freight, too heavy, streamed along the haunch,<br>
Hang for these harpies' hideous delight,<br>
Poor rag of flesh, torn of thy sex and sight!</i></p>
<p><i>Cythera's child, child of so sweet a sky!<br>
Silent thou bearest insult&mdash;as we must&mdash;<br>
In expiation of what faults deny<br>
Thee even a shallow shelter in the dust.</i></p>
<p><i>Ludicrous sufferer! thy woes are mine.<br>
There came, at seeing of thy dangling limbs,<br>
Up to my lips, like vomiting, the streams<br>
Of ancient miseries, of gall and brine.</i></p>
<p><i>Before thee, brother in my memory fresh!<br>
I felt the mangling of the appetites<br>
Of the black panthers, of the savage kites,<br>
That were so fain to rend and pick my flesh.</i></p>
<p><i>The sea was sleeping. Blue and beautiful<br>
The sky. Henceforth I saw but murk and blood,<br>
Alas! and as it had been in a shroud,<br>
My heart lay buried in that parable,</i></p>
<p><i>All thine isle showed me, Venus! was upthrust,<br>
A symbol calvary where my image hung.<br>
Give me, Lord God, to look upon that dung,<br>
My body and my heart, without disgust.</i></p>
